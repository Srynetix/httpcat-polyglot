# http.cat polyglot project

Implement a simple http.cat/http.dog client in various programming languages and technologies, as a learning exercise.

## Expectations

For each language / technology included in "implementations", the app should:

- expose a command-line interface to query http.cat or http.dog,
- validate the HTTP status code,
- display the resulting picture as ASCII art in the terminal.

The code should be clear, documented, and as idiomatic as possible.

CI should be setup, with automated tests, lint and formatting.

## Available implementations

- Go (85%)
    - Needs CI

## Roadmap

- Rust
