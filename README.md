# http.cat polyglot project

Implement a simple http.cat/http.dog client in various programming languages and technologies, as a learning exercise.

## Expectations

For each language / technology included in "implementations", the app should:

- expose a command-line interface to query http.cat or http.dog,
- validate the HTTP status code,
- display the resulting picture as ASCII art in the terminal.

The code should be clear, documented, and as idiomatic as possible.

## Available implementations

- Go
- Python 

## Roadmap

- Rust
- Swift
- Kotlin
- Zig
